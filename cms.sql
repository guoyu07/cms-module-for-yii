Within the hosting market today we can obtain dedicated  hosting, virtual, free (without ads) and reseller hosting. Now, we will  canvass each aspect of reseller hosting service. This case of hosting is  the most economic for someone that starts a Internet firm. The term  \"Reselling\" misses technological specification or specific set up that  would distinguish it as a website hosting type. <br /> <br /> Foremost, a reselling hosting is basically a service obtainable by a  webmaster who already bought a hosting service. It is then leased out to  other clients at a higher cost. This is called a reselling operation.  In another words, the large company has purchased the hosting service at  a wholesale level and is reselling it to a microscopic company in  uncoupled partitions. Therefore, it is similar leasing out their  megabytes and bandwidth. Shared, Virtual Private Server (VPS), (Managed  or/ Semi-dedicated) or any form of site hosting service can be resold.  and skills to make known itself on the net. <br /> <br /> Virtually every reseller web hosting vendor are small company owners who  are just starting their business in hosting industry. A reseller  ordinarily targets a medium market where the need for web hosting plans  isn&rsquo;t too tremendous. It commonly provides solutions that does not  design to deal with higher requirements. Greater web hosting vendors do  not cater servings like this and this is where reseller hosting service  is worthy. Thence, the web hosting vendors for this type of service can  produce some earnings simply by marketing successfully. Almost every  reseller hosting plan provides support to the Resellers directly to you  entirely; on the other hand should you need to seek support on behalf of  one of your customers they surely will be able to aid you in doing so.<br /> <br /> Hence, if you are preparing to adventure into the web hosting industry  as a reseller host, you have to scout around to find out the hottest  business deals. Then, you have to promote it successfully and  productively to find your niche industry. The service that you offer  must also be excellent. In order to earn more clients, you will require  to distribute your bandwidth and diskspace efficiently too. To ensure  happiness for your clients, whatsoever problem that they describe must  forward to the original provider. This, not merely easinesses the job of  the reselling hosting procedure, but also provides solutions for both  the master supplier and your customers. If you have never used reseller  hosting control panels, your firm will assist with setting up your  introductory package and there is a large quantity of data and knowledge  bases ready for you to get up to speed on the basics. Your reseller  hosting package will have a narrow share for web space and bandwidth  sold to you in bulk, which you can divide into smaller hosting accounts  with limitations further suitable for ecommerce and personal hosting in  addition to to offer additional commercial enterprise products and  services (like domains, extra bandwidth, free seo consultation and so  on).<br /> <br /> Reselling web hosting services is the best option for those who are  trying to begin a net profession for the first time. It is great for  those who are building up a residence established establishment with  small wallet. A handful of users can lease a dedicated server and that  is why it is the advisable way out. It provides decent diskspace and  bandwidth sufficient for you to create a site that you can use for any  intention.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, reseller web hosting is by all odds a sought internet service  due to its rare characteristics that provides one to do numerous things  with limited means. It is extraordinarily worthy for particular cases of  users and especially for the businesspersons who are making their way  into the Internet hosting business.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>',1,'#','2010-07-03 00:00:00','2011-09-06 11:24:28',1,0,0,0,0,'mapImage_1315301068_bO87t2.jpg',''),(32,'Technique of Web Hosting','technique-of-web-hosting','',NULL,'<p>The technique that allows computers or servers to host web sites is  known as web hosting. The facility of web hosting is provided by various  service providers. Web hosting is important as it enables a user to  access any site in the world. Also, it allows one to store textual and  visual information, apart from other Internet matter on the website  mediums. <br /> <br /> There are various kinds of web hosting services from which you can  choose from. Some companies provide you web hosting services for free,  while some charge the user. There are certain drawbacks of using free  web hosts. This is because there are certain limitations regarding the  services they provide. Moreover, a user is not provided with customer  service, and is not provided uptime guarantee. The limitations on  bandwidth, advertising and edit sites may hamper the growth plans of a  company. <br /> <br /> Thus, it is advisable that you pay for the web hosting service. However,  a user should take into consideration his needs before selecting a web  hosting service provider. Depending on a users data transfer, disk space  and other necessities, the service can cost him anything between $10 to  $5000 per month according to his usage is extensive. Also, the payment  can be done on monthly, annually or semi-annually basis. <br /> <br /> In addition to your needs, web hosting reviews must also be taken into  account before selecting a web hosting service provider. The reviews or  ratings of the service providers are available on the Internet. Various  service providers can be compared on the basis of price, traffic and  space. One should also take into account the bonus or additional  features provided by the web hosting providers. It is advisable that one  should read the blogs regarding the web hosting service providers. They  help you get a realistic feedback and thereby help you in selecting the  best web hosting service provider. <br /> <br /> Some of the other points that must be considered while choosing a top  web hosting service are,<br /> 1.	Bandwidth<br /> 2.	Server Space<br /> 3.	Control Panel<br /> 4.	Support<br /> 5.	Script access<br /> <br /> The bandwidth capacity should be more than of 500 MB. However, it does  not make sense to pay for capacity which you will not use. For people  who run small businesses, bandwidth of one gigabyte is enough. The same  holds true for server space. For personal use, 50 megabyte capacity is  sufficient. Select the web hosting service provider that offers a user  24/7 customer service. This is because, in case of a problem, the  customer centers will solve your problem. One can also visit their site  and read the FAQ&rsquo;s, since they add to the knowledge of a person. <br /> <br /> The control panel provided by the service providers should be a simple  version as will be easy to use. Make sure that the web hosting service  providers facilitate you with script access. It may not be required at  that moment but, may be useful for future purposes. <br /> <br /> Since the best web hosting service adds efficiency and success to the  business, due consideration must be given in selecting a service  provider.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>This original article is the property of WebHostingGeeks.com -  independent customer and webmaster reviews of top 10 <a href=\"http://webhostinggeeks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">web hosting</a> providers.

You can get answer to this question if you read or heard the  bio-graphy of some successful peoples.<br /> <br /> Definitely nobody would have attained their success in their first  effort or attempt. In real life you may <br /> see numerous popular personalities in cinema or in the sports field,etc.<br /> <br /> It is common to see the peak of any favorite artist or sports  personality. Today we are able to see their <br /> continuous box office hits,medals and awards. But it may not be possible  for most of us, the struggles they paid to attain this continuous box  office hits,medals,and awards.<br /> <br /> Even some artists have told in their bio-graphy that the director who  refused chances or assignment in the entry stage, is now waiting for  years together for their call sheet.<br /> <br /> They would have never minded about their image, health, working hours,  because their only aim at that time of entry would be that they should  got recognition in the cinema industry.<br /> <br /> Today thousands and thousands of fans are waiting to see their glimpse  for a few seconds and hundreds of directors are waiting for their call  sheet to their next film. Companies are showing their face in the small  screen and earning millions of dollars as profit.<br /> <br /> They come to this present stage only after paying some hefty things like  hard work, dedication, sincerity, etc. They didn&rsquo;t come to this stage  in all of a sudden.<br /> <br /> <strong>\"Poruthar Boomi Alwar\"</strong><br /> <br /> They come to this stage after falling down many times. But they raised  again and walked towards their dream.<br /> <br /> You want to go to a multi storied building. It was some 24 storied  building.You have to go to 24th storey. <br /> <br /> Can you go to that 24th storey by pulling yourself straight to that 24th  storey.<br /> <br /> Definitely you can&rsquo;t. You have to cross the steps in between the 24th  storey building. May be you can go fast <br /> by skipping some one or two steps. But it is difficult to skip more than  that.<br /> <br /> You may argue, why should I go by foot when I can go in lift.<br /> <br /> Even the lift can pass one by one storey only and it cannot go straight  to 24th storey.<br /> <br /> When we are following these principles for the impossible and  impracticable things in our routine life,we have to use these principles  when we want to achieve success.<br /> <br /> It is natural that most of the peoples wanted to get their success in  one instance or one attempt or one effort.<br /> <br /> There is one proverb in Tamil, one of the Indian oldest language. It  says \"Poruthar Boomi Alwar\". It means those who have much patience will  be the king of the world one day.<br /> <br /> There may be only one in thousand that the success may come in a single  effort. But let us talk about the practical happening.<br /> <br /> We must all aware that the success got in one single effort will have  only a short span of life. Because getting success without any strain or  struggle cannot last long.<br /> <br /> You may not have the chances of learning lessons and techniques to  refine your self or in the field of profession you relate when you got  your success in a single instance.<br /> <br /> The success you get after prolonged efforts,strains,experiences will  alone last for ever. It is permanent. It teaches you lesson, knowledge,  techniques, etc. You will gain Himalayan strength, knowledge, tehniques,  etc. and you will have the power to keep up that success.<br /> <br /> Experiences are nothing but failures. You can get these experiences only  out of your failures. There is no other ways and means in this world to  get these experiences.<br /> <br /> \" ....Think that failure is your well-wisher.\"<br /> <br /> Even the world best teacher cannot teach you what an experience teaches  you.<br /> <br /> Everybody should be lucky enough to get failures. You should not panic  about the failure.<br /> <br /> You must get rid of the fear of failures. You should think that failure  is your well-wisher.<br /> <br /> When you get rid of the fear of failures the \"success\" will be ready to  accompany you for your journey towards the peak.<br /> <br /> At the same time if a person who got his/her success in a single  effort,h/she cannot tolerate even a single failure.<br /> <br /> H/she will be soon vanished from the scene after that single failure.  H/she won&rsquo;t have the courage to adjust him/herself for that single  failure.<br /> <br /> But the person who wants to climb the peak of success never mind about  the failures,abuses,while passing through that journey. His/her only aim  will be to clinch the victory at the peak.<br /> <br /> Only failures can create so many geniuses in this world. When that  genius reveals his/her failures to the world,those failures inspire and  attract so many souls and create so many geniuses in this world. Failure  and success are law of nature.<br /> <br /> It is H/she picturise the failure as undesirable and success as  desirable.<br /> <br /> But failure should be picturised as desirable with due respect because  it teach us many lessons even a world best university cannot teach.<br /> <br /> So let us invite failure,get rid of the fear of failure,think failure as  our friend,march towards the peak of success till we clinch the victory  with the lesson we learned out of failures.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This article was contributed by Krishnan C. of Tiruchirapalli,India for  Universal Psychic Guild, online provider of <a href=\"http://psychicguild.com/\" target=\"_blank\">free horoscopes</a> and <a href=\"http://psychicguild.com/reports.php\" target=\"_blank\">astrology  reports</a>.

Do you think  about how to fix whatever is wrong, or do you get stuck?<br /> <br /> The story you tell yourself about who you are in the world has an  enormous influence on how you approach problems. There are lots of  different popular story themes that lead to different actions.<br /> <br /> \"I\'m a competent person.\" You notice the resources you have available -  money, friends, time, transportation, etc., and start using them to find  a solution.<br /> <br /> \"I never do anything right.\" You notice all your mistakes, criticize  yourself for having the problem, wait around hoping someone else will  fix the problem, and put off any action. You may do something to help  you forget the problem like take a nap or read your junk mail.<br /> <br /> \"It\'s not my fault.\" You notice everything that others do wrong and  spend a lot of time and energy telling them about it. You are angry that  they don=t take your advice, and complain to your friends about how  incompetent people are. <br /> <br /> \"If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.\" You stay on  top of all the details and make sure everything is done correctly. You  are super responsible, over committed and exhausted. <br /> <br /> \"I live in a wonderfully exciting world.\" You see problems as  challenging opportunities. You explore creative solutions, and if they  do not work out, you try new ones.<br /> <br /> The stories you tell yourself are like old habits. They are familiar and  comfortable. If you change your story, you will start to notice  different things about the world, and these will lead you to take  different actions. <br /> <br /> If you are living a story you do not like, choose a new one to try on  and play with. It\'s a little like buying a new outfit. Spend a few  minutes every day reminding yourself about your new story. <br /> <br /> Draw a picture that represents your old story. Then draw a picture that  is the essence of your new story. Explain the differences to a friend.<br /> <br /> Write out your new story. Paste it on your bathroom mirror, your  refrigerator, your desk, or the steering wheel of your car. Read it each  time you see it. <br /> <br /> Every time you are reminded of the new story do something - hum a few  bars of a song, make a phone call, or recall something you enjoyed - to  make the new story come true.

Having some peace of mind in a crazy world is the only way  that many of us can stop ourselves from actually being driven crazy or  getting caught up with life, work and an ever-commercialized world and  forgetting what we set out to accomplish in the first place.<br /> <br /> What Is Peace Of Mind?<br /> <br /> Peace of mind is having some time dedicated solely to yourself. It is  all about taking the time to connect with the person inside and find  some peace and quiet from a world gone mad. Peace of mind is about  reflecting on your life and within this quiet reflection time, learning  to re-adjust and cope with situations that, at times, get the better of  us, before they have the chance to spiral out of control. <br /> <br /> Yes, peace of mind is time that you take away from everything going on  in your life and all around you to find peace and solitude. It is within  the peace and solitude that we find the answers to our questions and  solve problems that are manifesting in our lives.<br /> <br /> Why Peace Of Mind Is So Important<br /> <br /> Peace of mind is so important in your mental, physical and spiritual  well-being. Without this careful reflection time, we are putting  ourselves in the same type of situation that a swimmer may, if he forgot  to come up to the surface for some air. Like the swimmer, we are  thrashing away in our daily lives, trying to get somewhere in a sea of  complexities. <br /> <br /> By taking some precious time out from our efforts or coming up for some  air, we get the chance to see our progress or strategize our lives for  the better. We can step out of our lives for a while and take a good  look at what is going on in our lives and the changes we need to make.  Without this time-out to seek peace of mind, we are destined to be  swallowed up in everyday living and lose track of what we originally set  out to accomplish. Or, worse still, lose track of who we really are.<br /> <br /> How To Get Peace Of Mind<br /> <br /> Now that we know the importance that peace of mind has in our lives,  let\'s look at how we should go about finding it. To start off, you need  to take some time out. Find some place where you won\'t be disturbed.  Take the phone off the hook, turn the computer off, lock all of your  doors, throw your pager out of the window, do what ever it takes to get  complete peace and quiet.<br /> <br /> The next step is to meditate. This doesn\'t necessarily mean that you  must sit under a triangle and say \'hummmm\'. Meditation is the act of  relaxing. So relax, take deep breaths and clear your mind of all of your  daily stress - it can all wait! Once you have relaxed, you will feel a  sense of peace coming over you. If you feel problems creeping into your  mind or things that have bothered you during the day - push them out,  keep that relaxed state of mind.<br /> <br /> As you are relaxing you will feel a tingling sensation come over you,  just like a warm and fuzzy feeling. This is your \'feel good\' endorphins  kicking in. At this stage, you will be feeling extremely calm. Sit there  relaxing, feeling peaceful and enjoying it until you feel that it is  time to finish your peace of mind session. Stay in the same position,  allowing your mind to slowly let thoughts begin to creep in. Sit like  this, just thinking quietly for a while, before you try to get up and  start moving around. When you finally do get moving, you will feel calm,  peaceful and ready to face anything.<br /> <br /> Conclusion<br /> <br /> Peace of mind is important to us, especially in the crazy modern world  of today. Just like a swimmer, we need to let our mind come up for air  every now and again and find a few moments of tranquility in our lives.  By doing this, we are more rational and able to face the things in our  lives that need to be tackled head on with gusto.<br /> <br /> Never put your mental, physical or spiritual well being last or feel  guilty for taking this time out just for yourself. Finding peace of mind  is one of the most important things that you can do for your well  being. It will benefit not only you, but those around you and those you  love, because you will be far calmer and well balanced when dealing with  them.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Kevin Sinclair is the publisher and editor of <a href=\"http://www.my-personal-growth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">my-personal-growth.com</a>,  a site that provides information and articles for self improvement and  personal growth and development.</p>',1,'#','2010-07-04 10:20:18','2010-07-04 13:52:25',28,4,0,0,0,NULL,NULL),(28,'Just Let It Go!','just-let-it-go_','',NULL,'<p>Fear, worry, tension, despair, and dread. It is a lot to handle. Gravity  can weigh you down so immensely. Do you feel the strain? Many people  say just hold on, things are bound to get better. Problem is, you need  relief right now. Things are too much for you and you don\'t think you  can take the torture of it for even another hour.<br /> <br /> If life has no joy and no reward other than pain and constant struggle,  then that is a whole lot to deal with. To survive which is something you  are not sure you even want to do you must go on. We cannot see into the  future, but we sure can loathe the present and agonize about the past.  Such heavy feelings would make our future seem bleak indeed. But despite  appearances, no situation is hopeless.<br /> <br /> Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do good things happen to  bad people? Why do good and bad things happen? Do good and bad people  cause them? Are they caused deliberately, or by mistake and ignorance?  Are there really good and bad people? Are there really good and bad  things, or are there just developments in process? Caught up in  whirlwinds, we often fail to see that things happen in cycles, that the  forces of nature have reason. That a turnaround is just around the  corner whether we do anything about it or not, as if we could control  the weather!<br /> <br /> Disconnect from the drama! Drop it! Let it go! Holding on to  expectations can only cause anxiety. Fate happens and our destiny will  unfold to our ultimate betterment. We are taught by experience and we  learn from experience, which means we are students of experiences. It is  the teacher, not the student that chooses the lessons and curriculum.  We have no control; a high power has already laid out everything that  will happen to us. There is nothing we can do about it and we cannot  blame other people or ourselves for the things that happen. So let it  go. Just let it go and have faith.<br /> <br /> It is always darkest before the dawn. Let go of the dark and let go of  the dawn. They are not real anyway. They are just for our entertainment  and learning. It is only a movie playing on a screen, and we have gotten  caught up in it, thinking that all that stuff is really happening to  us. Life is just a dream. You know how real dreams can seem, but then  you wake up and you know it was just an airy nothing. That is the way  our life is. Knowing that life is just a stage and we are only acting a  part in it is the way to rise above it. This knowledge is the key to  freedom.<br /> <br /> Let go your responsibilities, let go your burdens, and let go your  cares. Do whatever it is you want to do, the things you really feel like  doing because you can do no wrong. There are no consequences because  whatever happens was meant to happen and would have happened no matter  what. You cannot affect it and you need not be affected by it. It is a  script already written and we are only puppets in a play tied to strings  of motivation that we mistake for free will. But it is not real. It is  an illusion.<br /> <br /> How happy go lucky would you be if you knew you were dreaming life? You  are dreaming life! We all are, but just do not know it! If you are  carrying the weight of reality right now... let it go. Lighten up. If  you have the weight of the world on your shoulders... let it go. Live  unencumbered. 200 years ago, today was as nothing to you, just as 200  years from now is as nothing to you today. Today is as nothing to you  both 200 years ago and 200 years from now. Just let it go.<br /> <br /> Forget your troubles. Relax. Open your mind and open your hands and you  will be grabbing hold of nothing. Everyone seems to think they need  something.

The advantages that credit cards have  over other traditional medium of payment likes checks is that the  transactions can be easily carried out without any lengthy paperwork or  delays. If you are a webmaster looking into offering credit card  transactions online, there are few things that you need to keep in mind  before you accept credit cards on you site. <br /> <br /> The first thing to work on is getting the right merchant account, if you  are planning on running a high risk online business or expect to handle  a large volume of transactions then you should consider applying for a  high risk merchant account, not only will a high risk merchant allow you  the added benefits of fraud protection, it will also allow payments in  multiple currencies. You should also clearly read through the paperwork  of the merchant account to understand the various charges that are  associated with a merchant account.<br /> <br /> The next step in credit card processing is to choose a payment  processing system, you do have the option of using a regular payment  gateway, however a payment processing system not only integrates into  you existing setup without much fuss, but it also ensures that you are  also protected from fraudulent transactions. If you are still in the  process of developing your site then you should definitely look for a  company that offers payment processing systems. Not only will the  payment processing system have a payment gateway integrated, but any  additional payment related services will also be catered for. If you are  in a high risk online business like a casino or gambling site, then it  is a must that you consider a secure and safe payment processing system.  <br /> <br /> In addition to choosing the right payment processing system and merchant  account, you need to make sure that you are aware of the various  developments that are taking place, by being aware you are not only  protecting yourself, but you are also making sure that your customers  are also protected from Phishing and other internet scams. A great way  to protect yourself and your customers is to apply for secure  certificates; secure certificates are a great way for you to offer  secure online shopping. The advantages of SSL are manifold not only do  you ensure that all transactions are safe; the customers also feel  confident shopping with your site. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day your site should be the right mix of security and  user friendliness, no one likes shopping with a site that has too much  inbuilt security and the converse also applies, if your site is nothing  but a single credit card processing page then chances are that customers  will not feel that comfortable entering their credit card details. The  idea is to make your site an ideal blend of user friendliness and  security.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>Jim Duncan is the author of this article on <a href=\"http://www.paymentsystem.com/\" target=\"_blank\">online payment  system</a>.

The  difference lies in the fact that, to run an online business  successfully, you will need to know the fundamentals of any business and  have an understanding of the dynamics that drive web-based businesses.  Let&rsquo;s break this up. To start a business, you will need to have:<br /> <br /> &bull;	A great business idea<br /> &bull;	A solid, realistic business plan, including the financing aspect<br /> &bull;	Understand legal issues<br /> &bull;	Understand accounting and taxation issues<br /> &bull;	Construct a marketing strategy<br /> &bull;	Create and maintain a customer base and plan customer service<br /> <br /> To start an online business, you will also need to:<br /> <br /> &bull;	Make sure your business idea works for an online business<br /> &bull;	Decide whether or not you need to start a website<br /> &bull;	If you do need a website, you will need the technical skill to know  how to start, run and manage one<br /> &bull;	Understand online marketing and advertising tactics and tools<br /> &bull;	Find new and creative ways to drive traffic to your start up online  business<br /> &bull;	Understand dynamics of customer interaction for an online business<br /> <br /> So start with your business idea &ndash; try to do a SWOT analysis, i.e. an  analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that  face your concept. Be sure it will work as an online business by  thinking &ndash; will people buy this product or service online and what value  can I offer online that a customer does not get offline? Find out about  legal issues surrounding your product or service before starting  anything. Determine your start up&rsquo;s business model &ndash; do you want to sell  on eBay or start a site or extend your offline store?<br /> <br /> Next, come up with a business plan &ndash; include all costs, all means of  possible financing, how you will achieve the financing, logistics of how  to procure the product and how to deliver it, and keep in mind that an  online business needs to have realistic projections of future income,  just like an offline one. Websites can be expensive to start and  maintain. Make sure you really need one and account for the expenditure.  Be sure that you find reliable service providers &ndash; such as the right  web host and pay channels. Consider accounting and tax issues in your  analysis and planning phase, so you will be realistic in your  projections.<br /> <br /> Build a comprehensive marketing strategy &ndash; understand the concepts of  internet marketing like search engine optimization (SEO), online  advertising, and other ways to increase traffic to your website. Finding  a great name is important &ndash; something short and simple. Further, make a  plan that includes effective and efficient customer service and builds a  database or mailing list of customers. Remember that this is an ongoing  process for any business and in the case of an online business, it is  even more crucial to stay ahead of the game. An online business does not  have face time with the customer so it&rsquo;s important to maintain a  healthy communication with all customers.<br /> <br /> Keep the above pointers in mind and start planning your way to a  successful online business.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>William King is the director of <a href=\"http://www.wholesalepages.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"> UK Wholesale  Drop Shipping Trade Supplies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailytrader.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Wholesalers Suppliers &amp; Drop Shippers Products  Directory</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aidandtrade.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Drop Ship &amp; Wholesale Drop Shipping Directory</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.francewholesalers.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> French  Wholesale Drop Shipping Directory </a>.

Promoting business through well-written informative  articles is one subtle, very simple and easy way to bring fame and  status to your company. <br /> <br /> Following the 5 tips mentioned below will help develop your skills for a  better article marketing.<br /> <br /> 1. Evaluate your writing skills.<br /> <br /> Not everyone is endowed with the talent of writing convincing articles  that will persuade readers to take action. Have your articles read and  evaluated by persons other than yourself and ask them for an honest  feedback. If you receive negative comments and you know very well that  writing is not your strong point, don?t hesitate to hire freelance  writers. <br /> However, this should not discourage you from writing more and developing  whatever little talent you have.<br /> <br /> 2. Test your resource box.<br /> <br /> The author?s resource box is a very vital element that you should  consider in writing your articles. Remember that the very essence of  your article marketing may greatly depend not just on the content of  your article, but also on how your resource box is written. Hence, you  should try various ways of presenting the essential contents of your  resource box and find out which version draws more surfers to visit your  business site.<br /> <br /> 3. Use the works of others as references.<br /> <br /> If people do not visit your site as you have planned, then something is  definitely wrong. <br /> Maybe the readers did not find your articles useful enough. Or perhaps  your resource box may not be as convincing as it should be. In cases  like these, you might want to use others? works as references. <br /> <br /> You can actually do a comparison between your articles and the articles  of other authors regarding same topics. Then try to find out if you can  do some changes to make your articles work better to your advantage. If  there is, then do the necessary revisions and you will eventually get  more and more people visiting your website.<br /> <br /> 4. Submit your articles manually.<br /> <br /> Some software can help you submit a great quantity of articles in less  time. <br /> However, some best online article directories and publishers do not  permit software submitters. So if you are using this software, your  articles will likely be rejected and your efforts are put to waste.  Hence, it is recommended that you manually submit your articles to the  best sites and avoid using software submitters unless absolutely  necessary.<br /> <br /> 5. Always Double Check spelling, grammar, and syntax of your articles. <br /> <br /> Never rush in submitting your articles without checking its contents at  least twice. <br /> You may have your articles printed or have them read out loud for you to  readily point out spelling and grammar errors. Erroneous articles tend  to get rejected or returned for revisions before they get accepted and  published.<br /> <br /> If you are able to follow the tips presented in this article, you will  soon experience the benefits of a better and improved article marketing  strategy.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>R.J.

I  have had a lot of success from it. I even had someone say I would not  lower myself to such a thing. <br /> <br /> My answer to that remark was as follows \"Did you know the person who  interviewed you for your job?\" \"did you know your wife or husband,  before you met them.\" As you can imagine the conversation quickly goes  onto other things!<br /> <br /> Why this misunderstanding and bad attitude. The seed of fear of people  is probably started from when mum and dad told us to be beware of  strangers, especially if they offer you sweets. <br /> <br /> For its purpose it was the right thing to do. However as we grow older  this attitude is carried on, and probaly grows worse as we get older.  How many of you would dare dream of going up to a stranger and offering  him or her a business opportunity.<br /> <br /> I think it is unfortunate we are not taught that strangers are un met  friends. It would make life a lot easier and free of fear and would also  help your attitude over lead generation for your particular business.<br /> <br /> Cold contacting (or warm prospecting) does work. I might suggest as  starters that you read skill with people by Les Giblin, how to win  friends and influence people by Dale Carnigie and the magic of thinking  big by david Swartz. <br /> <br /> When I say read, I mean study them and put into practice what you read. I  challenge you to do this for 21 days and watch your attitude to other  people grow.<br /> <br /> You can certainly see that if you are to develop a business and make  money, then you need people.<br /> Dedicate at least 2 hours exclusively to making a written list of  everyone you know; everywhere. Include acquaintances from years ago. <br /> <br /> Names of people who live over 150 miles away and whom you do not see  frequently should be written on a separate \"long distance\" list. your  sales team should \"brain storm\" together in making their list, avoiding  any screening out by pre-judging people while making the list. (You  never know who has a dream or needs money, life insurance or a mortgage  etc. So you should talk to everyone).<br /> <br /> If your first list does not contain at least 100 names, you are probably  pre-screening. Don\'t pre-screen, as the only requirement for people to  do this lead generation business is that they have a dream or a goal.<br /> <br /> Your first list will continue to grow rapidly for several days as you  keep recalling people, so keep a pen and paper with you at all times.  This list becomes a starting point for both building a network and your  core business, and will continue to grow as you meet new people.<br /> <br /> Q. What do you do when you run out of names?<br /> <br /> A. Talk to people and ask Questions! <br /> <br /> Develop an awareness of people every day. Make it a habit. Your biggest  source of people is new acquaintances you can get to know better. Learn  to be a good listener.<br /> <br /> The following is only one example of how to prospect people for your  business. Talk to your mentor and listen to the suggested tapes and cds  for many other approaches. I would also advise that you attend as many  conferences as possible and associate with successful people, especially  in your field.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>DrS has successfully been in sales over 30 years.

This is mainly because these subscribers want to know more about  what these sites are offering and can be beneficial for them. They  expect to get be kept posted on what they are interested in and what are  new in the market or field they have chosen.<br /> <br /> Businesses would be so lucky to have these kinds of customers; the basic  element needed to get these types of people is trust. When your  customers trust you they will reward you with their loyalty. Many  internet users have gone to great lengths in protecting their email  accounts from spam mail. Some free-mail internet providers and internet  service providers offer spam protection while there are also some  internet based companies that screen your mails for you. <br /> <br /> With an opt-in mail list, the mails you send containing your promotional  materials such as newsletters, catalogs and marketing media will go  through. Your intended recipient will be able to read and view what you  have sent making it a successful transfer of information. To be able to  be allowed to do so, you will need permission from your recipient, to  get this permission; you need to be able to get their trust. With the  great lack of disregard for privacy in the internet, getting the trust  of an internet user you dont personally know is a big achievement. <br /> <br /> To build a good opt-in list you need people to trust you, for a faster  and quicker build up, you need to get your opt-in subscribers to trust  you quickly. The faster you build your opt-in list the faster word about  your site and company gets to be spread. The bigger the scope of your  opt-in list the more traffic you get spelling more profits. Its easy  math if you think about it. Getting the numbers is not that simple  though, or maybe it is? <br /> <br /> * Getting the trust of your clientele should not be so hard especially  if you do have a legitimate business. Getting your customers trust  should be based upon your expertise. People rely on other people who  know what they are talking about. Garner all the knowledge and  information about your business. If you decide to go into a business  most probably you have an interest in it. Like how many basketball  payers become coaches, you dont really venture into something you dont  have any interest in.<br /> <br /> * Show your clients that you know what you are talking about. Provide  them with helpful hints and guidelines that pertain to what you are  selling. Talk about how to install a roof if your into hardware products  or provide articles on insurance settlements if youre a settlement  lawyer. You dont have to be a big corporation to make use of an opt-in  list. If your customers see you as someone who knows what he is doing  and saying, they will trust you quickly.<br /> <br /> * Be true to your customers, if you want to hype up your products and  services, provide guarantees. The more satisfied customers you get, the  bigger probability there is that they will recommend you. Generally,  people will trust someone they know, when that someone recommends you  then youre a shoo-in. They will go to your site and check it for  themselves and be given a chance to experience what the other shave  experienced from you, so make sure to be consistent in the service you  provide.<br /> <br /> * Another tip in getting a customer to trust you quickly is to provide  them an escape hatch. Show them that you are not there to trap them.  Keep a clean list that would enable them to unsubscribe anytime they  want. Elaborate your web form by providing information on how to  unsubscribe from the list. Guarantee them that they can let go of the  service when ever they want to. Many are wary that they may be stuck for  life and would have to abandon their email accounts when they get  pestered with spam. <br /> <br /> Remember that when you get the trust of your clients dont lose that  trust. Because if you do anything with their email addresses like sell  them or give them out, you will lose many members of your list as ell as  potential members. The true quickest way to gain the trust of your  subscribers is when you are recommended by someone they trust.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.articlesupdates.com/\">Article  Source</a>: http://www.articlesupdates.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Chris Peterson  Learn <a href=\"http://www.affiliate-homebusiness.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Opt  In Listbuilding</a> and <a href=\"http://www.affiliate-homebusiness.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Marketing</a> from Chris at his <a href=\"http://www.affiliate-homebusiness.net/\" target=\"_blank\">affiliate  training</a> website.</p>',1,'#','2010-07-04 12:05:08','2010-07-04 12:05:08',28,5,0,0,0,NULL,NULL),(39,'dfsd','dfsdf','sfdsfsf','dsfsdfs','<p>sdfdsfsdf</p>',1,'#','2011-09-06 10:46:38',NULL,1,0,0,0,54,'',NULL),(37,'sfds','sdfs','sdfs','sdf','<p>sdfsdfs</p>',1,'#','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2011-09-06 05:52:45',0,0,0,0,6,'',''),(38,'tests','ssss','sfsd','sdfs','<p>sdfsdf</p>',1,'#','2011-09-06 05:54:09',NULL,0,0,0,0,48,'',''),(40,'3433434','','','','<p>sdfsffsf</p>',0,'#','2011-09-06 11:09:51',NULL,1,0,0,0,2,'',NULL),(41,'322332','','23223','','<p>23232323</p>',0,'#','2011-09-06 11:34:21',NULL,1,0,0,0,60,'mapImage_1315301661_j0c4eb.jpg',NULL);
